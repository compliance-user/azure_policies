    "description": "It is recommended to review PublicIP. Manual steps: You can remove private and public IP addresses from a network interface, but a network interface must always have at least one private IPv4 address assigned to it.  In the box that contains the text Search resources at the top of the Azure portal, type network interfaces. When network interfaces appear in the search results, select it.  Select the network interface that you want to remove IP addresses from the list.  Under SETTINGS, select IP configurations.  Right-select a secondary IP configuration (you cannot delete the primary configuration) that you want to delete, select Delete, then select Yes, to confirm the deletion. If the configuration had a public IP address resource associated to it, the resource is dissociated from the IP configuration, but the resource is not deleted.",
